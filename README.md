A silly 2D game written in Processing, controlled by serial data from Arduino.

This project was a part of my final project for a digital electronics course.  See my [starfire](https://github.com/montemishkin/starfire) repo for another game that was part of the same project.  Also check out my [digital-electronics-final](https://github.com/montemishkin/digital-electronics-final) repo for the writeup that accompanied these two games.
